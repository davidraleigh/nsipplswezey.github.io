What makes a great teachincal blog post?

1. Short
1. Reproducible
1. Visual

Where did I get this idea?
From my two favorite github workflow articles, from which I learned two very different but effective ways of using git for production.

http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

The funny thing is, they're both long, somewhat reproducible, but very delightfully visual.
